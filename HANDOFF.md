# Personal Agent - Claude Integration Handoff Document

## Current Situation
We've integrated Claude CLI into the Personal Agent plugin for UbiquityOS, but the GitHub Action is not executing the plugin code correctly. The action runs successfully but doesn't process the event or generate a Claude response.

## Branch
- **Working Branch**: `claude-integration`
- **Pull Request**: Not created yet, but changes are pushed

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Claude Agent Handler
- **File**: `src/handlers/claude-agent.ts`
- Replaces the basic "hello world" handler
- Extracts commands after `@username` mentions
- Executes Claude CLI with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
- Uses temporary files for prompts
- Handles output cleaning and error cases

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Updates
- **File**: `.github/workflows/compute.yml`
- Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger for manual testing
- Default test payload simulating an issue comment with `@0x4007 Hello Claude!`
- Installs Claude CLI via npm: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Uses `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for authentication
- Test mode bypasses signature verification (NODE_ENV=local)

### 3. Build System
- **File**: `build-action.js`
- Uses `@vercel/ncc` to bundle the action with all dependencies
- Creates a single `dist/index.js` file for fast execution
- No npm install needed at runtime

## The Problem

### Symptom
When the GitHub Action runs ([example](https://github.com/0x4007/personal-agent/actions/runs/17342871947)):
1. It successfully starts
2. Shows "Reassembling parts in: /home/runner/work/personal-agent/personal-agent/dist/plugin"
3. Says "No files to reassemble."
4. Exits without processing the event or calling Claude

### Root Cause
The `dist/index.js` file contains the wrong code. It's currently the old "reassembly" script instead of the bundled plugin action. This is evident from the first lines:
```javascript
import fs from "node:fs";
import { builtinModules } from "node:module";
import path from "node:path";
// ... reassembly code
```

Instead, it should contain the bundled action starting with:
```javascript
import{createRequire as e}from"module";var t={4914:function(e,t,r){...
```

## What Needs to Be Fixed

### Primary Issue
1. The `dist/index.js` is not the correct bundled action file
2. The `build-action.js` script runs correctly and generates the right bundle, but something is overwriting it
3. The old `dist/index.js` (reassembly script) needs to be permanently replaced with the ncc bundle

### Steps to Fix

1. **Ensure correct build**:
   ```bash
   bun build-action.js
   ```
   This should create the proper bundled `dist/index.js`

2. **Verify the bundle**:
   ```bash
   head -1 dist/index.js | cut -c1-50
   ```
   Should show: `import{createRequire as e}from"module";var t={...`
   NOT: `import fs from "node:fs";`

3. **Find what's overwriting the file**:
   - Check if there's another build process
   - Look for any GitHub Actions that might be rebuilding
   - Ensure the committed `dist/index.js` is the bundled version

4. **Test the fix**:
   - Commit the correct `dist/index.js`
   - Trigger workflow: `gh workflow run "Personal Agent Compute" --repo 0x4007/personal-agent --ref claude-integration`
   - Should see Claude processing the command and attempting to respond

## File Structure

```
personal-agent/
├── src/
│   ├── action.ts          # Entry point for GitHub Actions
│   ├── index.ts           # Main plugin logic (imports claude-agent)
│   └── handlers/
│       └── claude-agent.ts # Claude CLI integration
├── dist/

│   └── package.json      # Simple {"type": "module"}

```

## Environment Variables Required
- `USER_PAT`: GitHub Personal Access Token
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`: Claude authentication token
- `PLUGIN_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Provided by GitHub Actions
- `AGENT_OWNER`: Repository owner (auto-set)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Manual Workflow Dispatch**:
   - Go to Actions tab → "Personal Agent Compute"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Use default values or customize the payload

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Action should process the event
   - Extract command from comment body
   - Call Claude CLI with the command
   - Post Claude's response (currently would fail due to missing issue/repo context in test mode)

3. **Current Behavior**:
   - Action runs the reassembly script
   - Finds no files to reassemble
   - Exits without processing

## Additional Context

- The project uses the UbiquityOS plugin SDK
- It's designed to run as both a Cloudflare Worker and GitHub Action
- The Claude integration is meant to provide intelligent responses to GitHub comments
- Reference implementation studied: `reference/claude-code-action/` (submodule)

## Key Files to Review

1. `dist/index.js` - Verify it's the bundled action, not reassembly script
2. `build-action.js` - Ensure it's correctly building and outputting to dist/
3. `src/action.ts` - The actual entry point that should be bundled
4. `.github/workflows/compute.yml` - The workflow configuration

## Success Criteria

When fixed, the GitHub Action should:
1. Load the bundled plugin code
2. Parse the event payload
3. Detect the `@username` mention
4. Extract the command
5. Execute Claude CLI
6. Log the Claude response (even if posting fails due to test environment)

The logs should show something like:
- "Executing claudeAgent:"
- "Processing command with Claude: Hello Claude! Can you explain..."
- "Executing Claude CLI command..."
- Either a Claude response or an error about missing CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
